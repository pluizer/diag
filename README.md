# Front-end for Allux's Celsus app.

Celsus is an AI app with the primary goal to help health care professionals think outside the box and to improve connections. Celsus will interconnect professionals of big health care organizations, connect treatment centers with each other and narrow the gap between general practitioners and specialists. This is important because in both physical and mental health care there is a huge amount of patients with complex needs. These patients usually experience multiple problems, which can be hard to diagnose.

When in need for advice on a patient, a professional can create a case from inside our app. The professional can fill in a list of symptoms, together with some general details, like gender, age etc, while leaving the patient identity anonymous. The case is then send to a feed of all other incoming cases. Upon opening our app the user is greeted with this feed. This personalized feed is sorted on the probable relevance the case has. Cases where input will likely be of value will be on top. Users can quickly train the system by dismissing the cases that have no relevance to them. From inside the app it is possible to quickly start a highly secure chat with relevant specialists or plan a meeting with them.
